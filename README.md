# Custos - Keep track of things you get from outside

Ever ordered a bunch of things from outside, let them sit in the garage/under the stairs for what was supposed to be 24 hours, and then forgotten about them for a week? 

Or have you ever picked something up thinking it's been there for days, only to realize that it's just been an hour?

You're not alone ðŸ˜†. All of us have faced this problem, so we decided to do something about it.

Team Mars Aeternum Proudly Presents, Custos.

## Custos lets you know when you can touch something.

We keep track of the time that you add an item, and suggest some recommended waiting times for you - you're free to choose your own.

## Find out when the timer elapses

the timer will become "SAFE" when it elapses.
